What our report tells us is that, at a time of unprecedented
political turbulence and uncertainty, people are still firmly
committed to taking holidays and they continue to be a
spending priority. Government figures show that spending
on overseas package holidays increased in 2017 and our
findings reinforce this picture.
Our research shows that 60% of the population took a
foreign holiday in the past 12 months â€“ the highest
figure since 2011 - with longer overseas breaks the
beneficiary. They also show that people managed their
budgets by reducing the number of UK breaks and shorter
overseas breaks and by cutting back on their
spending while they are away.
